          The weather forecast didn't say that, but the steel plate in his hip
          did. He had learned over the years to trust his hip over the
          weatherman. It was going to rain, so he better get outside and
          prepare. Sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things
          don't work out as planned. This had been his life for the last three
          months and he was just beginning to get used to it. He didn't actually
          enjoy it, but he had accepted it and come to terms with it. Or at
          least he thought he had. All that changed when he put the key into the
          ignition, turned it and the engine didn't make a sound.
